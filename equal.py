traffic_sim.py  Version 2.0


OVERVIEW

This Python script simulates automotive traffic arriving at a traffic light.
The script demonstrates the following:

(1) several basic principles of discrete-event simulation, including the
representation of system states, the connection between events and changes of
state, and the Poisson process,

(2) the use of the SimPy module,

(3) simulation of random deviates using NumPy, and

(4) the use of Python generator functions.


THE MODEL

Cars drive on a single-lane road and arrive at the intersection from one
direction only according to a Poisson process with specified rate.  Positions
and velocities of the cars are not modeled, and there is thus no coordinate
system.

The traffic light switches between green and red at regular intervals; there is
no yellow state.

When a car arrives at a green light with no cars queued, it passes immediately
through the intersection and departs the simulation.

When a car arrives at a red light or with one or more cars queued at the
intersection, it stops and joins the queue.

When the light turns green, if there is a queue, cars enter the intersection one
at a time.  Once a car has entered the intersection, it clears the intersection,
regardless of the state of the light, after a delay that is a random draw from a
triangular distribution.


INPUTS

All inputs are hardwired into the code.


OUTPUTS

The simulation generates a trace of events as it runs, and also reports
estimates of the average number of cars in the queue and the average waiting
time.


FUTURE WORK

This model might be extended in any of several directions.  Some possibilities
include the following:

(1) There are several sources of bias in the average waiting time: (a) The
simulation starts with a green light.  (b) The simulation starts with no cars
queued.  (c) Cars remaining in the queue at the end of the simulation do not
contribute to the estimated waiting time.  The effects of (a) and (b) might be
mitigated by eliminating the initial transient; this would involve collecting
and saving individual waiting times, choosing alternative values for the
duration of the initial transient, generating estimates using only the data
outside of the transient interval, and then selecting one of these results using
some statistical criteria. (We want the mean of the selected result to have no
statistically significant difference from results based on longer transient
intervals, but otherwise we want to discard as little of the data as possible).

(2) The delay of the driver at the head of the queue in responding to the change
of the light from red to green could be made somewhat longer than that of
drivers who are further back in the queue.  This would allow for greater realism
in the model without explicitly modeling positions and velocities of the cars.

(3) One might have some fraction of the cars make a right-turn at the light,
with the remaining cars going straight, and compare the capacity of a
single-lane road, a two-lane road with no turn restrictions, and a two-lane road
with a dedicated right-turn-only lane.
